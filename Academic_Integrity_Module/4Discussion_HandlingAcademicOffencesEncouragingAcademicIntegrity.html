<p style="font-size: 18pt"><strong>How you can promote academic integrity</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 14pt; text-align: justify;">Most students do not want to commit academic offences. All students"ought to know" about academic offences and yet many do not have a clear understanding of them. The best way to combat this is to prepare a brief session with your students to clarify what constitutes as an academic offence.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14pt">Here are some things you should cover:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 14pt">
    <li>What is and isn't allowed in your tutorial/practical (e.g. mathematical aids, phones, etc.)</li>
    <li>Academic offenses that you feel are lesser known or misunderstood among the student body</li>
    <li>Academic offenses that you feel are most common in your course</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 14pt; text-align: justify;">Plagarism is one of the most common and yet most misunderstood academic offences. It comes up not only in writing but also in programming and mathematical logic. Try to clearly define it to your students and differentiate it from other similar terms.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14pt; text-align: justify;">Finally, remember that a key part in reducing academic offences is instilling loyalty towards academic integrity within students. <strong>YOU</strong>, the TA, are the face of academia for these students. As such, they are more likely to uphold academic intergrity if they can connect with you on a more human level.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14pt">You can encourage this by:
    <ul style="font-size: 14pt">
        <li>Showing the students that you genuinely care about their success</li>
        <li>Showing and explaining why you personally care about academic integrity</li>
        <li>Guiding strugglong students to academic resources that you personally have found useful or hear are effective</li>
    </ul>
