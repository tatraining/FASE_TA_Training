<p>You will have minimal time for preparing for the tutorial, even though preparation is essential for having an effective tutorial.</p>
<p>If you don't know the material, prep time might be spent reviewing the material for yourself so that you're confident to explain the material. Review the assigned material, even if you&rsquo;ve taught the material before.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re working through problem sets with students, make sure you do the problem sets yourself first. Work through any exercises yourself first, etc. This will allow you to identify potential problem areas and plan your lesson accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know the material but want to present it in a new or interactive way, use your prep time to prepare new activities or handouts, or how you will divide groups.</p>
<p>At the very least, use this time to prepare questions! Questions for opening the topic and for reviewing previous knowledge, for assessing logic and breaking up complex material into smaller, more easily understood, parts and for assessing whether the students understand the application and extension of the concepts beyond this class to future class and course material. Preparation prevents poor performance!&nbsp;</p>
