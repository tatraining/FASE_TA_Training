    <p><strong>LEARNING OUTCOME: </strong>a statement that describes the knowledge, skills and attitudes students should acquire by the end of a particular class (or course).</p>
</div>
<p><br />They help students understand the rationale for developing this new knowledge and acquiring particular new skills and attitudes, and they suggest to students how their learning will be assessed.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>Ask Yourself:</strong> at the end of the tutorial, what do you expect your students to have learned?<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>What are the major things that you would like your students to know (e.g., facts, theories, concepts, models, etc.) at the end of a tutorial?</li>
    <li>What are the major things that you would like your students to be able to do (e.g., skills, abilities, procedures, etc.) at the end of a tutorial?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your learning outcomes must be observable, measurable, and phrased so they state what the learners will do. <span>To guide you in the creation of effective learning outcomes, please consult the handout on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tatp.utoronto.ca/teaching-toolkit/ci-resources/ta-ci-relationship/blooms/"><em>Active Verbs for Bloom&rsquo;s Revised Taxonomy</em></a><span>.</span></p>

    <p><span><strong>Course learning outcome:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>By the end of this course, students will be able to describe the energy of a system.</p>
    <p><span><strong>Goal for tutorials:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>These tutorials will expose students everything they need to create a variety of energy systems from the internal combustion system, to wind turbines to solar panels, and understand how they work to produce one type of energy from another.</p>
    <p><strong>Overall tutorial learning outcome:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>By the end of the term, students will be able to define and differentiate between the necessary components in each of the major energy systems and where efficiency is lost or gained in that system or a given system.</p>
    <p><span><strong>Specific tutorial learning outcome:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>By the end of this tutorial, students will be able to describe the components of a wind turbine, examine the functionality of its components by contrasting different styles of turbines and assess their efficiency in converting wind to electricity.</p>
    <p><span><strong>Tutorial learning activity:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>In this lab you will compare the efficiency based on two case studies of equal-sized wind farms in Denmark and South Korea over a 5 year period and use this data to produce a report detailing the durability of the two different types of wind turbines and their contribution to their respective communities and determine whether these projects were good investments for the respective communities.</p>
