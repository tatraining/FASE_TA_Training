</div>
<p>To determine the overall tutorial learning outcomes ask the Course Instructor (CI) about the broad goals of the tutorial. Use the <a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file" title="Tutorial Planner (Overall).pdf" href="https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/172821/files/8037008/download?wrap=1" data-api-endpoint="https://q.utoronto.ca/api/v1/courses/172821/files/8037008" data-api-returntype="File"><em>Overall Tutorial Planner</em></a> to&nbsp; identify the key outcomes that the CI has for the tutorials. This planner will help you organize content for each specific tutorial throughout the semester or year.</p>

<p>For your tutorials, you will have to consider how to engage your audience, make the subject matter interesting and engage your students in thinking critically about the content. To help you design and deliver a successful and effective learning experience to your students, consider these 8 tips, and follow along with the <a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file" title="Tutorial Planner (Specific).pdf" href="https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/172821/files/8037053/download?wrap=1" data-api-endpoint="https://q.utoronto.ca/api/v1/courses/172821/files/8037053" data-api-returntype="File"><em>Specific Tutorial Planner</em></a> template.<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 15pt;">1. </strong><strong>Establish the learning outcomes for the tutorial.</strong> <br />Identify and focus on 2-4 learning outcomes in each of the tutorials. Make sure to always tell your students what the learning outcomes are for each of the tutorials. It is sometimes helpful to put an outline for that day&rsquo;s class on an overhead transparency or in one corner of the board. Indicate not only what activities you&rsquo;ll be doing and what exercises/problems you&rsquo;ll be working on, but how much time you&rsquo;ll be allotting each part of the class. Indicate what the overall goal is for that day.</p>
<hr style="border: 1px solid #349eeb;" />
<p><strong style="font-size: 15pt;">2. </strong><strong>Open the tutorial with a bridging activity or assessment. </strong> <br />Never assume that you have a full grasp of what your students know. Always make sure to identify your students&rsquo; existing knowledge so that you can build on what your students already know. New knowledge is constructed from old but quite often, we are in a rush to cover content without checking what students already know about a topic. A pre-assessment activity or quiz will activate students&rsquo; prior knowledge and prepare them for what is to come in the tutorial. Keep it light-hearted as you are only trying to figure out what they know rather than discouraging them by pointing out their limitations.</p>
<p><strong>For TA's facilitating first-year courses:</strong> remember this is a brand new learning environment for first-year students! They all come with different levels of knowledge and understanding, so don't assume that they understand the content, and be okay with them not knowing the content.&nbsp;</p>
<hr style="border: 1px solid #349eeb;" />
<p><strong style="font-size: 15pt;">3. </strong><strong>Open your tutorial with a &ldquo;hook.&rdquo;</strong> <br />Grab your students&rsquo; attention and build their interest in the topic.&nbsp;</p>
<hr style="border: 1px solid #349eeb;" />
<p><strong style="font-size: 15pt;">4. </strong><strong>&nbsp;Be organized</strong><br />Navigate the timing of your tutorial so that you don&rsquo;t run out of time or content. Determine the most effective activities/structures and resources to engage your audience. A good idea would be to use a variety of active learning strategies to tap into their different learning styles and engage your students. Consult the handout on <a href="https://tatp.utoronto.ca/teaching-toolkit/active-learning/active-learning-adapting-teaching-techniques/">Active Learning and Adapting Teaching Techniques</a> for a list of active learning activities that can be completed by students working as individuals, pairs, small groups or the entire class.</p>
<hr style="border: 1px solid #349eeb;" />
<p><strong style="font-size: 15pt;">5. </strong><strong>Provide a close/summary of the key takeaways.</strong><br />At the end of the tutorial, summarize the learning and re-emphasize the learning outcomes to provide closure to your students.</p>
<hr style="border: 1px solid #349eeb;" />
<p><strong style="font-size: 15pt;">6. </strong><strong>Check whether these intended learning outcomes were met.</strong><br />This can be achieved through a quick formative assessment, poll, or discussion during or at the end of the tutorial.&nbsp;</p>
<hr style="border: 1px solid #349eeb;" />
<p><strong style="font-size: 15pt;">7. </strong><strong>Be cautious of time.</strong><br />Estimate the time each task will take, and be prepared to find out that your estimate is low. Be aware of hidden time demands (administrative issues, explanation of test procedures or assignments, questions from lectures, setting up technology, rearranging the room, etc.).&nbsp; Prioritize your established tasks to ensure that you cover the most important concepts/subjects and consider making use of time-controlled activities (group work, think-pair-share).</p>
<p><strong>For TA's facilitating first-year courses:</strong> it is extremely important to include buffer time so you can answer any questions students have, even ones that aren't related to the academic content of the tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<hr style="border: 1px solid #349eeb;" />
<p><strong style="font-size: 15pt;">8. </strong><strong>Take the time for a personal reflection.</strong> <br />At the end or after the tutorial, identify both the strengths and weaknesses of the teaching experience. Assess the success of the lesson plan after each class and adapt for the next week.&nbsp;</p>
