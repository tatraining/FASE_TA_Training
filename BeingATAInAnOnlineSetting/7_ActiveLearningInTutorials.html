        <strong>Active Learning Strategies in Tutorials:</strong></span>
        <br />
        <ul style="color: black;">
            <li>As you teach, stop periodically to ask questions to the students to monitor their understanding.</li>
            <li>Wait a sufficient time after asking a question to allow students to formulate their answers. Make sure you wait at least 10-15 seconds for an answer; sometimes even 20 or 30 seconds is better. The longer you wait, the more profound and accurate your students&rsquo; answers will be because they will have had sufficient time to consider their answers.</li>
            <li>Ask questions that can be partially answered from information just presented to encourage participation.</li>
            <li>Listen carefully to student responses. Use eye contact, non-verbal cues such as nodding, and facial expressions to indicate that you are interested in what they are saying. Be sensitive to student vulnerabilities when they answer questions in the first few classes.</li>
            <li>Get them to reach a consensus on what issues/topics they would like to discuss in the course.</li>
            <li>Encourage student interaction (i.e., get the students talking to each other and commenting on other students&rsquo; questions and answers, not just talking to you).</li>
        </ul>
