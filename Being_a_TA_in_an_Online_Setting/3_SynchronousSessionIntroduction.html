    <p>Holding a live webinar session offers real-time connection between the instructor and student as well as student-to-student interaction. A live webinar session can provide a social community experience.</p>
    <p>There may be a need for recordings or alternatives for students with logistical challenges related to time zone or bandwidth. Provide the opportunity for text chat since not all students are comfortable using a mic and/or webcam.</p>
    <p>Join the session early with all the materials you will need.</p>

    <p><span>Begin by sharing an <a title="Example Intro Slide" href="https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/172821/pages/example-intro-slide" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-api-endpoint="https://q.utoronto.ca/api/v1/courses/172821/pages/example-intro-slide" data-api-returntype="Page">opening slide</a> while students join the session, for example, showing how to use BBCollaborate tools. You can also include the course name, number and your name and contact information on this slide, or in the chat.</span></p>
    <p>Converse with students as they enter the session. Treat students with respect and show interest in them. It is important to immediately establish a rapport with them.</p>
    <p>Introduce yourself by telling them something about yourself. Tell them how to address you (first name only? Mr./Ms./Mrs.?) and the pronouns you use (she/her, he/him, they/them). Tell your students your background, interests, etc. Establish your credibility. It is important to build a sense of community from the beginning so don&rsquo;t be afraid to introduce an introductory activity even in a larger class.</p>
