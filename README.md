# FASE_TA_Training
When working on pages that have already been developed, please create a branch (based on the master) to sandbox the code
Test your page on an unpuclished demo page ouside of the modules, this allows the modules to stay functional during updates
Once you are sure that you have your final product, create a pull request for your page and copy the code to the actual page on Quercus 
Unless there are major issues, the pull request will be merged shortly
